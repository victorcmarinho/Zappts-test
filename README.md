1)	Layout development should be used with SASS (SCSS). 
2)	During the development of this TEST project in the CSS file it is important to use SASS variables and also mixins, (colors, font family, font size, etc.)
3)	Animation: The slider should work with auto play, and when you click on the slider dots controls, the slide should switch to the nex one (for all others slides you can keep the same text and picture)
